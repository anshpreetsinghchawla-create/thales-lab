# Getting Started in Quantitative Finance

Welcome to the **Thales Open Quant Initiative**! This guide is for anyone new to quantitative finance, data-driven investing, or financial modeling. No prior experience is required — just curiosity and willingness to learn.

## 1. What is Quantitative Finance?

Quantitative finance (or **quant finance**) uses **mathematics, statistics, and programming** to analyze financial markets and make trading, risk, and investment decisions.  

Key areas include:  
- **Factor Models**: Identify characteristics like value, momentum, or volatility that explain stock returns  
- **Portfolio Construction**: Combine assets to balance risk and return  
- **Risk Modeling**: Measure potential losses under different market conditions  
- **Market Microstructure**: Study how trades, orders, and liquidity affect prices  
- **Data Engineering**: Collect, clean, and process market or economic data  

> Think of quant finance as using **numbers, code, and logic** instead of guesswork to understand markets.

## 2. Tools You Will Use

Most projects in this repo use:

- **Python** – main language for data analysis and modeling  
- **Jupyter Notebooks** – interactive coding and results visualization  
- **Libraries:**  
  - `pandas` – data manipulation  
  - `numpy` – numerical computation  
  - `matplotlib` / `seaborn` – plotting and visualization  
  - `scipy` – scientific computing  
  - `statsmodels` – statistical models  
  - Optional: `TA-Lib`, `yfinance`, `cvxpy`  

> Other languages like R, Julia, and C++ may also appear in some projects.

## 3. How to Start

1. **Pick a project** folder from the repo (Factor Models, Portfolio Strategies, etc.)  
2. **Read the README or notebook documentation** to understand the logic  
3. **Run the notebook** step by step to see outputs  
4. **Experiment**: modify parameters, add new factors, or try different datasets  
5. **Ask Questions**: contribute to discussions or issues if something is unclear

## 4. Learning Resources

- **Books:**  
  - “Quantitative Finance for Dummies” (beginner-friendly)  
  - “Python for Finance” by Yves Hilpisch  
- **Online Courses:**  
  - Coursera: Financial Engineering & Risk Management  
  - QuantInsti: Algorithmic Trading & Quant Courses  
- **Communities:**  
  - Stack Overflow / Quant StackExchange  
  - Discord or Slack channels for data science & quant projects

## 5. Tips for New Contributors

- Start small: focus on one notebook/project first  
- Document your learning: keep notes or markdown cells in your notebook  
- Don’t be afraid to ask for help: collaboration is part of open-source  
- Learn by building: tweak parameters, add features, and analyze outcomes  

> Quant finance is learned by doing. Reading helps, but **building and experimenting** is where the magic happens.
