# Thales Open Quant Initiative

**Open-source quant finance projects by Thales Capital** — making quantitative research transparent, practical, and inclusive.

This repository is a collaborative space to **learn, build, and share real-world quant research**, from factor models and portfolio strategies to risk modeling and market microstructure. Every project includes:

- Concept overview and intuition  
- Mathematical logic and references  
- Python (and other language) implementations  
- Results, interpretation, and extension ideas  

## Projects
- **Factor Models** – value, momentum, and custom factors  
- **Portfolio Strategies** – mean-variance, risk parity, factor-based allocation  
- **Risk & Regime Models** – volatility surfaces, regime detection, tail risk  
- **Market Microstructure** – order book analysis, market impact simulations  
- **Data & Utilities** – loaders, generators, and preprocessing pipelines  

## How to Contribute
1. Fork the repository  
2. Build or extend a project  
3. Document your logic and results clearly  
4. Submit a pull request  

We encourage contributions in Python, R, Julia, C++, and other languages. Please respect the **MIT License** included in this repo.
